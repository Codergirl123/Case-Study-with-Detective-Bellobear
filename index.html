<h2> Wireless Computer mouse </h2>
<h4>Google Lens: Wireless Computer Mouse <br>
    Mobile Net: Computer Mouse <br>
    More Accurate: Google Lens is more accurate, but both are correct
</h4>
<br> <br> <br>
<h2>ACCURACY CHECK: <br>
Google Lens: 4/4 <br>
Mobile Net: 1/4<br>
Which can we rely on more? - Google Lens
</h2>

<h2> Why does Detective Bellobear think that Google Lens is more accurate than Mobile Net?</h2>
<h4>
    Hello everyone! It's me, Detective Bellobear! Above are some examples of objects that have been identified by Mobile Net and Google Lens. As you can see, Google Lens has identified each object correctly, as Mobile Net didn't. That is not the only reason why. Mobile Net is programmed with 1.3 billion images, but Google Lens has the whole internet to search images. This means that it can go through websites such as Amazon. Therefore, we can rely on Google Lens more!
